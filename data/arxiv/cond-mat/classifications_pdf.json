Key explicit claims include (i) degeneracy of the flux Jacobian at ρ1 = ρ2 = 1/2, (ii) vanishing first-order current in the symmetric point, (iii) a second-order current form that depends only on a and q, (iv) the continuum limit being two coupled Burgers equations with coupling X determined by q, and (v) universality across general jump rates under a product stationary measure, with a four-parameter universality class after constraints. Additional explicit notes concern special limits (TASEP), parameter reduction, and the diagonal X = Y locus. The classifications above map these statements to a structured hypothesis space with justification, variables, and expected outcomes for potential empirical/theoretical validation."

I extracted the core testable propositions and mechanistic inferences, labeling each with its epistemic type, structure, and predictive direction where applicable. Some items are explicit (e.g., thickness-dependent ThC, interfacial TBR effects on heat flow), while others are implicit (e.g., design guidance that thicker channels/buffers improve heat dissipation; PDOS-mismatch as the cause of higher TBR). To avoid duplication, each hypothesis is listed once, even if discussed across sections. If you want stricter quoting of exact sentences as hypotheses, I can reformat each item to align with verbatim quotes from the text. "

Hypotheses were extracted from statements describing optimal growth windows, parameter effects on morphology (roughness, porosity, grain shape), stoichiometry control (2:3 BT ratio), and interfacial sharpness (Te seed/cap and Te cap roles), as well as observed phenomena (spiral growth) and methodological claims (PLD vs MBE). Each hypothesis was categorized along the provided taxonomy, with variables identified and a justification tied to specific textual cues from the Results and Discussion sections. Where exact phrasing was available, quotes from the article were incorporated into hypothesis_text. Duplicates were avoided by grouping closely related claims under single, clearly defined hypotheses when they referred to the same underlying testable proposition. Any hypothesis that was purely observational without a testable causal or predictive claim was classified as descriptive/non-directional where appropriate. If you want a tighter or more granular set (e.g., splitting H2 into separate H2a/H2b across more parameters), I can refine accordingly.>"

Each hypothesis has been classified along the taxonomy axes and anchored to explicit text in the paper. Duplication was avoided by treating each distinct claim (method accuracy, method limitations, cross-method comparisons, and finite-temperature predictions) as separate hypotheses. Where quotes were available, exact phrasing from the text was used. If a claim is later nuanced or qualified in the discussion, it is reflected in the justification and notes."

Duplicates were avoided by treating each distinct claim about mechanism, performance, neuromorphic function, and generalization as separate hypotheses. Where possible, I used phrases directly tied to the paper (e.g., “giant barrier modulation of 900 meV,” “memory window (1.8 V),” “ultrafast switching (100 ns),” “hysteresis originates from reversal of α-In2Se3 ferroelectric polarization,” “CCV below 2%,” “MNIST accuracy 95.8%”) to anchor the hypothesis texts and classifications."

Additional hypotheses address the dynamics of entanglement rates, the emergence of force chains under vibration, and the distribution of tensile strength (log-normal fits) across configurations. All hypotheses have been classified and tied to specific quotes and results in the paper; the evaluation_status reflects whether the data support each claim."

Each hypothesis is identified in the text (explicitly or as a result) and classified along epistemic, structural, predictive, functional, temporal axes, with listed variables, predicted directions, and a confidence assessment. Citations and exact phrasing are paraphrased where necessary for compact presentation; quotes incorporated are faithful to the surrounding statements in the document. If a hypothesis is primarily methodological (e.g., about the form of the variational principle or Gaussian trace reduction), it is labeled as a methodological/implementation hypothesis with details in the notes.

We identified hypotheses (explicit and implicit) that span (i) the existence and nature of the Néel ground state and its TN, (ii) the presence and magnitude of the 1D spin gap Δ in the dimerized chain regime, (iii) the dependence of TN and Δ on interchain and intrachain exchange parameters, (iv) the necessity of S = 3/2 over S = 1 (or other) to explain the data, and (v) the topological transitions associated with dimerization. Each hypothesis was classified on epistemic type, structural complexity, predictive direction, temporal framing, and whether it concerns implementation/transferability, with a confidence estimate and concise justification. Duplicates across sections were avoided by treating each distinct claim (e.g., Néel ordering, spin gap, interchain coupling as the tuning parameter, spin value, and DFT-based validation) as separate hypotheses.
