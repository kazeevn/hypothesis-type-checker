    "processing_notes": "The paper presents a core empirical claim of universal loss-curve collapse under compute-optimal scaling (H1) and a strong secondary claim of supercollapse under LR decay (H2). It provides several theoretical pillars (H4–H7, H12–H13) that formalize when and why collapse should occur (power-law frontiers, balance of power laws, SGD-noise modeling) and extensive empirical validation across architectures (transformers, MLPs) and tasks (CIFAR-5M, chess/Lichess). Additional hypotheses (H9–H11, H14) address normalization choices, suboptimal scaling as diagnostic, cross-architecture generality, and the existence of a joint scaling limit. The hypotheses have been filtered to avoid duplicates and labeled with explicit texts where possible, along with justifications and variable mappings derived from the paper’s equations and figures (notably Figures 1–6, 7–14 and the Theorems in Appendices E–F). Where text quotes are used, they reflect the paper’s own phrasing or closely parabolic paraphrasing of the intended claim (e.g., universal collapse, supercollapse, the role of L0, the Hor̄izon t⋆(p), and the two-power-law loss forms)."

The central empirical hypotheses concern (i) the feasibility of a minimalistic, all-attention AoT architecture achieving performance competitive with standard transformers (Table 1–2 results; ImageNet and language tasks), (ii) the interpretability of attention heads (Figure 7), and (iii) the in-context learning capabilities of AoT approaching GPT-2 performance on linear/sparse linear tasks (Table 3, Figure 5). Several modeling/hypothesis items (Definition 2.1; alignment with linear representation and superposition hypotheses) are presented as assumptions or explanatory constructs for the method rather than independent testable predictions; these are included as hypotheses here to reflect their role as underlying claims about token representations. Some explicit design-related claims (e.g., MSSA as a special case of MHSA; no MLPs in AoT) are treated as hypotheses about architecture identity and equivalence rather than empirical outcomes. If desired, the list can be pruned further to include only the strictly testable predictions (e.g., Theorem 3.1 and the comparative performance claims) for a more focused analysis."

We extracted explicit hypotheses from these Takeaways and from supporting text, figures (notably Fig. 2, Fig. 4, Fig. 5–6, and related tables), and from the Discussion/Conclusion. In addition to explicit Takeaways, we included a few implicit, testable predictions that are clearly supported by the authors’ interventions, such as the transferability/generalization implication (H6) and the usefulness of loss-to-loss scaling for balancing downstream tasks (H7). Citations to specific sections/images: Shifted power-law behavior (Eq. 1; Fig. 2) in §3–§4; pretraining data as dominant factor (Fig. 4; §4.1); minor tokenizer/architecture effects (Fig. 5–6); limited impact of size/context/optimizers (Fig. 7–9); point-wise Mamba vs Llama comparison (Table 1, Fig. 11); conclusions on data-centric priority (Discussion/Conclusion §6).

The hypotheses above were distilled from explicit claims (e.g., improved ASR with REINFORCE, asymptotic consistency) and implicit claims evidenced by results across multiple models (Gemma, Llama, Vicuna), defenses (circuit breakers), and ablations (sampling strategy, AdvPrefix). Key empirical anchors include: ASR comparisons in Tables 1–3 and 7–9, ablations in Table 4, runtime tradeoffs in Table 6, and circuit-breaker evaluations in Table 3. Figures illustrating reward dynamics (Figures 5–6) support the causal interpretation that changing objective and sampling strategy drives changes in Harmful outputs. The hypotheses are intended to be treated as testable, falsifiable claims about the effects of the proposed objective, sampling strategies, transferability across models/tokens, and interactions with defenses. Where text explicitly states theoretical properties (e.g., asymptotic consistency), those are translated into hypotheses with appropriate epistemic type and justification. If a hypothesis was not directly supported by a clear, testable claim in the manuscript (e.g., broad general statements about offline assessment future work), it was not included as a separate item."

Hypotheses were extracted from explicit result statements, figure/table captions, and the discussion surrounding results in Section 6 and Appendix C. Where the paper explicitly quotes results (e.g., Table 3, Figure 3, Table 5, Table 11, Figure 6), those statements were used to anchor the hypothesis texts and justifications. Some hypotheses are interdependent (e.g., robustness and budget effects) and were kept distinct to reflect separate testable claims.

The hypotheses above cover: (i) the detrimental effect of in-training symmetry, (ii) the benefits and limits of post hoc symmetry (PA) versus other methods (DA, GA, SC, PC), (iii) theoretical results that underpin the empirical findings (Fact 2.1, Theorem D.1, Lemma 6.1, Theorem E.1), and (iv) practical observations such as saturation with more symmetries and the mixed results when extending PA (Gen(G), translations). All hypotheses have been consolidated to avoid duplicates across sections (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion). When quoting hypothesis text, I used explicit phrases from the paper (especially the abstract and section headers) to ground the classifications. If you’d like, I can attach page references to each hypothesis for traceability or convert this into an annotated extract with direct in-text quotes. "

It also reports empirical evidence: higher privacy budgets (ρ) improve accuracy, more participating machines (m) improve accuracy, and the proposed noise-cancellation approach yields competitive accuracy with linear time complexity compared to baselines.

Hypotheses were then classified along the provided taxonomy (epistemic type, structural type, predictive type, etc.), with variables listed and directions inferred from the reported results (e.g., directional if a clear increase/decrease is described). To avoid duplication, each hypothesis is listed once even if referenced in multiple sections (e.g., results and ablations). If a sentence represented a design choice rather than an empirical prediction, it was treated as a hypothesis only when an explicit test of that claim was reported.

All hypotheses were extracted once per unique claim to avoid duplicates across sections. Where exact mathematical statements could be quoted, the verbatim forms from the manuscript were used; otherwise, precise paraphrases reflecting the authors’ claims were provided. The temporal type for the theoretical results is set to confirmatory, as these are proven statements within the paper, while the empirical findings are treated as confirmatory when they validate the theoretical bounds.

Where the text explicitly discusses comparisons, ablations, or correlations, I distilled those into testable predictions (e.g., stability, performance, reward decoding correlation). Confidence scores reflect the strength of the evidence presented in the paper (experimental results and/or theoretical arguments).

Quantitative support is drawn from Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 5.1–5.4, and Appendices E and A, including figures and tables cited in the notes. Encoder robustness (H4) and design-choice ablations (H7) are especially supported by the ablation analyses in Section 5 and Appendix E, while cross-task/LLM generalization (H6) is evidenced by performance across ten benchmarks and three LLMs (Section 5.1)."

Each hypothesis was labeled with its text, classified along the taxonomy axes (epistemic type, structural type, predictive type, etc.), and linked to the relevant variables and results (e.g., references to Tables/Figures and Theorems where the claim is tested or established). Duplicates were avoided by consolidating similar claims (e.g., single-slot optimality, BundleNet’s multi-slot performance) into unique hypotheses. Where a claim was primarily theoretical (Theorem 4.3, Lemma 5.1), I treated it as descriptive/theoretical with confirmatory temporal stance. Where the claim described empirical results (Tables/Figures), I treated it as confirmatory and predictive. If you’d like, I can provide a compact evidence map mapping each hypothesis to the exact figure/table/section in the paper."
