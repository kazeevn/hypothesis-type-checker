I identified explicit statements and derivable inferences that function as testable hypotheses, including (i) numerical accuracy claims about the modified midpoint scheme and velocity reuse, (ii) error-propagation bounds in the reverse pass, (iii) comparative performance (speed, reconstruction quality, CLIP-based editing quality) versus baselines, (iv) ablations about the number of editing steps, (v) compatibility with other editing methods, (vi) zero-shot/training-free capabilities, and (vii) documented failure modes/limitations. I included both explicit quoted sentences when available and precise paraphrases aligned with the paper’s claims. Each hypothesis is categorized along the taxonomy axes, with explicit variables, directionality where present, and a confidence score reflecting how directly the paper supports the claim. Where the claim is a limitation or a methodological property, I labeled it accordingly as descriptive or transferability as appropriate. If you want me to tighten any hypothesis wording or map to additional subtypes (e.g., more granular variable lists), I can refine this further."

For each hypothesis, I quote exact phrasing where possible (e.g., statements about “restricting to the text stream” and the gains reported in Tables), and classify across the taxonomy (epistemic_type, structural_type, predictive_type, etc.). I also included explicit transferability-related hypotheses (similar-voice vs divergent-voice transfer) and multi-turn generalization hypotheses, as well as a couple of future-work hypotheses (online RLHF, privacy-preserving data collection) drawn from the limitations/future work sections. If you want me to prune to only strictly experimental hypotheses (i.e., those directly tested in the results) or to reorganize by a particular axis (e.g., all Transferability hypotheses together), I can reorganize accordingly."

The core hypotheses are primarily formal statements/theorems about convergence rates under various smoothness regimes (L-smooth, (L0,L1)-smooth, (ρ,L0,L1)-smooth, etc.), and are complemented by explicit experimental validations that compare the proposed step-size rule against alternative rules (notably Li et al. 2024a) on carefully constructed test functions. The Experiments section (pages 11–12) provides concrete, falsifiable claims about iteration counts to convergence and instances of divergence when using non-ℓ-smooth step sizes or when the growth of ℓ is too strong (e.g., s^2 growth). I separated the purely theoretical results (Theorems and Corollaries) from the empirical observations (Experiment A/B/C). Some items are explicit comparisons (e.g., Method X vs Li et al.), while others are intrinsic properties of Algorithm 1 (e.g., monotonicity of ∥∇f(x_k)∥, per Theorem 8.3). If a tighter extraction of exact formulae from the paper is needed (due to some LaTeX-to-text rendering quirks in equations), I can refine the quoted hypothesis text to align precisely with each theorem/corollary. For now, the collection covers the full spectrum of hypotheses that are explicitly stated or clearly implied by the results and experiments in the paper."

Each entry includes the exact or near-exact claim text as presented in the paper, along with a structured classification across epistemic type, structural type, predictive type, temporal type, functional type, and the specific hypothesis category. Where the paper presents research questions or methodological claims (e.g., a composition theorem), these are treated as descriptive/associative hypotheses about the existence or performance of algorithmic constructs. The variables identified focus on inputs (n, k, ∆, V, d), algorithmic outputs (approximation ratio, update time, recourse), and auxiliary constructs (MIS, sparsifiers). Confidence scores reflect how directly the item corresponds to a testable claim reported in the text. If a passage presents a theorem or lemma, it is treated as a hypothesis with a formal claim that is proven in the paper. If you want, I can add more granular hypotheses (e.g., individual lemmas like Lemma 2.1 about DynamicMIS) with the same schema."

The authors do not present formal, numbered hypotheses in the traditional sense; instead, they state explicit claims about performance (e.g., comparisons to baselines), methodological advantages (cooperative dual-conditionals, soft marginal constraints, pretraining), and behavior under parameter ablations (guidance scale). I extracted testable, explicit or implicit hypotheses from these claims and results, labeling them with the provided taxonomy and including exact quoted phrases where available (e.g., performance claims in sections 4.1 and 4.2 and accompanying figures/tables). Each hypothesis includes the text, epistemic type, justification, variables, predicted directions, temporal stance (confirmatory), functional type, and a confidence estimate. If you want a thinner or broader set (e.g., only explicitly stated performance claims vs. all methodological assumptions), I can prune accordingly. Key evidence references: PBMC and BM results (Section 4.1, Table 1), SNARE-seq results (Table 4), AFHQ/CelebA-HQ image-translation results (Table 2, accompanying text), guidance-scale ablation (Figure 8a), and methodological exposition in Sections 2-3 and Appendix A. For full reproducibility, see the paper’s figures/tables cited in each hypothesis (e.g., PBMC results on page 6, image-translation results on page 7-9, ablation on page 8-9)."

The authors also show that these phenomena generalize across models and that layer freezing can reveal the layer-specific storage of information. Finally, linearized extractive scores (IC, DC, UC, RC) provide first-order perturbations that approximate causal effects for efficient computation.

The authors perform ablations to test (i) multi-source grounding vs single-source grounding, (ii) aggregation methods (intersection vs union), (iii) guidance strength gamma and its dynamic variant, and (iv) cross-task/generalization and upper-bound comparisons with MARINE-Truth. Claims supported by figures and tables include: Figure 1 (MARINE framework), Table 1-3 (CHAIR/POPE across models), Table 6-7 (ensembling and intersection vs union), Figure 2 (text quality), Table 5 (latency), Table 25 (ALOHa), and Appendix A/B/C (detailed settings, ablations). The embedded images and captions (e.g., Figure 1 and Figure 7) provide visual evidence of the proposed mechanisms (logit-space gating, aggregation of object grounding, etc.). If you need a CSV or a more compact list for downstream analysis, I can generate that as well. "

The analysis also emphasizes the critical role of covering-number bounds and the OCD decomposition in bounding the value-function class (Section 6 and Appendix B). Lemma 5.3 formalizes the necessity of pure exploration in non-star-convex spaces, while Lemma B.3–B.7 and Lemma D.3–D.5 provide the technical scaffolding for optimism and bounding arguments. Experimental results (Section 7, Appendix A; Figures 6–10) provide empirical confirmation of sublinear regret and zero safety violations in autonomous driving scenarios, both in star-convex and non-star-convex settings.

Additional tested/observed claims include the effects of prompt design on performance when using logic-enhanced models (Hypothesis 7), the comparative difficulty of conclusion-generation tasks (Hypothesis 8), and trade-offs when applying logic-based enhancements (Hypothesis 9). The paper also reports a confidence gap between non-rulebreaker and rulebreaker responses (Hypothesis 11) and a DS vs MT difference in accuracy (Hypothesis 12). These hypotheses are drawn from the Introduction/Methods/Results/Discussion sections and are supported by figures and tables (e.g., Figures 3–7, Tables 2–4, 8–10) and the accompanying narrative.

I also extracted theoretical propositions about the properties of Hoyer sparsity (non-transitivity) and cosine (transitivity), which underpin the methodological rationale. Additionally, several implicit/implicit-but-testable claims are embedded in ablation studies and downstream task applications (e.g., robustness to paraphrase density, quality of GPT-4 data, and generalization across datasets). Each hypothesis has been classified along all axes per the taxonomy, with variables and directionality noted wherever describable from the text. If you want, I can provide a compact per-hypothesis justification snippet or extract verbatim quotes for each hypothesis text. "

I identified explicit hypotheses (and closely related implicit predictions) across three layers: (a) surrogate modeling (structural-aware DK-GP vs alternatives), (b) optimization scheduling (Hyperband vs full-fidelity), and (c) end-to-end HbBoPs performance (compared to HB with random proposals and to baselines across multiple benchmarks and LLMs). I also included hypotheses derived from ablation results and encoder sensitivity analyses, and I noted generalization-related hypotheses about validation-to-test transfer and the latent-space interpretation of the deep kernel. Confidence scores reflect how directly the statement is presented as a testable claim in the text. If you want, I can align each hypothesis with exact figure/table references and extract precise numeric effect sizes for further meta-analysis."

I identified explicit or strongly implied testable propositions across the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion: (1) comparative domain coverage superiority, (2) real-world gear-insertion transfer advantages, (3) modeling of multimodal reward landscapes, (4) graceful degradation with increasing parameter ranges, (5) benefits of the GoFlow objective, (6) use of pφ(ξ) as an OOD detector to inform planning, (7) existence of Preπ/Effπ-based belief-space preconditions enabling planning, (8) Bayes3D uncertainty enabling information gathering, and (9) active information gathering improving long-horizon assembly. Citations to supporting content include Figure 2 (multimodality in the reward), Figure 3 (coverage results), Table 1 (real-world gears), Appendix A.6 (coverage vs range), Section 4 (GoFlow objective), Section 6 (belief-space planning), and Appendix A.4.1 (Bayes3D).

The work provides (a) theoretical results bounding target risk with respect to source risk under domain shift (Theorem 4.6) and (b) empirical risk bounds (Theorem 4.7), along with identifiability of PNS under exogeneity and monotonicity (Lemma 4.4).

For transparency, page references when citing these items range roughly from pages 1–7 for model definitions and theory (Sections 3–4) to pages 7–15 for experiments (Sections 5) and page 19 for general guarantees (Conclusion).
