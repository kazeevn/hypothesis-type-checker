Each hypothesis was classified along the taxonomy axes (epistemic type, structure, predictive nature, etc.), with variables mapped to the involved components (DoA encoder, number-of-speaker encoder, Z_spatial embeddings, WER/MAE metrics, on-device metrics, etc.). Where possible, I quoted exact phrases from the text to anchor the hypothesis and indicated evaluation status as reported (supported vs. not_evaluated).

Some items are presented as design/capability claims (e.g., batched symbolic computation, recursion, black-box function support) and were transformed into testable hypotheses about capability and differentiability.

The items labeled as hypotheses include explicit theorems, central lemmas, and key assumptions that drive the paper’s claims. Where the authors present exact theorems, those are treated as hypotheses with their stated conclusions. Assumptions (e.g., Assumption 2.3, Assumption 3.1, Assumption 3.2) are included as hypotheses since they define the conditions under which the hypotheses (theorems) hold.

I identified explicit hypotheses encoded as the stated theorems and lemmas, plus implicit empirical hypotheses in Section 5 that validate the theory (e.g., the impact of g’s estimation error on f’s learning). Each hypothesis was categorized along epistemic/structural/predictive/functional/temporal/specific axes, with variables listed and a confidence rating reflecting the strength of the paper’s theoretical guarantees or empirical support. Duplication was avoided by treating each theorem/lemma as a unique hypothesis, and by summarizing the experimental claim as a separate hypothesis."

We identified explicit theoretical guarantees (Theorems 4.1–4.3, Corollary 4.4, Lemma 6.1) and several explicit empirical/experimental hypotheses (e.g., tightness of product-based bounds in Fig. 1b, robustness across tail distributions, performance superiority on real data and under mis-specification). We also included implicit hypotheses about the desirability of adapting concentration bounds to the zero-inflation parameters and about broader hierarchical extensions. No duplication across sections was allowed; each item corresponds to a distinct claim or testable proposition in the paper."

Based on these observations, the authors propose REAP (Random Registers Enhanced Attention Perturbation) with a two-stage training strategy (random perturbations during source-domain training to promote domain-agnostic representations, followed by finetuning with learnable registers during target-domain adaptation). The hypotheses above summarize explicit claims and implicit assumptions tested in the experiments, including effects of prompt type, register quantity, placement, hyperparameters, and cross-backbone generalization. These hypotheses are inferred from the Introduction, Method, Results, Ablation Studies, and Visualization sections and are not duplicated across sections."
